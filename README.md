# decidimGeo-Leaflet-prototype
Prototype of a low dependency map frontend for Geo-Decidim, featuring a web server for placeholder data

## How to run it ?
Considering you already installed yarn globally on your your computer:

Use the command 'yarn' in the root folder of the repository in order to install the web server dependencies

Use 'yarn start' to run the web server

You can now test the map in your browser on http://localhost:3000
